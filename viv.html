        <p><strong>Summary —</strong>
          This project focuses on reducing VIV of circular cylinders using passive control methods.
          I worked on both the experimental setup (low-speed wind tunnel) and numerical simulations
          using OpenFOAM, comparing different control geometries and their effect on lift, drag, and
          vibration amplitude.
        </p>

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>
          On the experimental side, I helped build and validate a low-speed wind tunnel and carried
          out tests on cylinders and airfoils, achieving around 96% agreement with reference data.
          On the numerical side, I implemented a 2D VIV solver in OpenFOAM and tested various passive
          devices such as splitter plates and control cylinders.
        </p>

        <h3>Key observations</h3>
        <p>
          Some passive devices significantly reduced vibration amplitude but at the cost of higher
          drag, while others provided a more balanced trade-off. The work highlighted how sensitive
          VIV is to wake structure and how geometric changes can redirect or damp the unsteady loads
          on the cylinder.
        </p>

        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>
          The project gave me experience in building a facility from scratch, validating it, and
          connecting experimental observations with simulation results. It also reinforced how
          important it is to understand wake physics when designing practical suppression strategies.
