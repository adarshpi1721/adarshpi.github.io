        <h2>Suppression of Vortex-Induced Vibrations (VIV)</h2>

        <div class="project-image-placeholder">Image Placeholder</div>

        <p><strong>Summary —</strong> This project looks at passive techniques to suppress vortex-induced vibrations of cylinders. I helped build a low-speed wind tunnel facility, validated it with airfoil and cylinder tests (accuracy up to ~96%), and developed an OpenFOAM solver to simulate 2D VIV. The goal was to pair experiments and simulations and test small passive add-ons that reduce oscillation amplitudes.</p>

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>We combined experimental rig-building with CFD. The experiments collected time-resolved transverse displacement and force data, while the simulations reproduced the same inflow and geometric parameters to test candidate suppressors — e.g., splitter plates, small control cylinders, and passive roughness patterns downstream. The solver was tuned against experimental benchmarks first, then used for parameter sweeps.</p>

        <h3>Key findings</h3>
        <p>Several passive devices helped reduce vibration amplitude in certain Strouhal ranges. Splitter-plates worked reliably when sized and placed correctly, while small downstream control cylinders sometimes delayed lock-in. The numerical solver matched experiment trends closely enough to be useful for design screening — which saved time and allowed us to test more configurations than would be feasible experimentally.</p>

        <h3>Challenges & lessons</h3>
        <p>Accurately capturing the vortex dynamics requires careful time-stepping and mesh resolution; coarse setups can entirely miss lock-in behavior. The main practical lesson was the value of combining experiments and simulations — experiments revealed real-world nonlinearities (structural damping, support friction) and simulations allowed fast exploration of geometric parameter space.</p>

        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>This project improved my experimental skills (wind-tunnel setup, instrumentation) and my CFD tuning abilities (meshing, solver validation). It also sharpened my engineering judgment about the trade-offs between suppression efficacy, structural complexity, and manufacturability.</p>
