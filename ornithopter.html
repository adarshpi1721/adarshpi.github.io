        <p><strong>Summary —</strong>
          This project started as an attempt to build a controllable flapping-wing aircraft and
          turned into a practical lesson in taking FSI ideas into hardware. I led the design of a
          dual-crank mechanism to generate bird-like flapping and later added a simple morphing
          mechanism at the trailing edge to improve thrust and stability.
        </p>

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>
          We first focused on getting a robust mechanical system: repeatable flapping kinematics,
          acceptable structural stiffness, and a reasonable weight budget. Once the basic
          ornithopter flew, I experimented with small morphing elements at the wing trailing edge
          and adjusted flapping frequency and amplitude to see how they affected thrust and control.
        </p>

        <h3>Key observations</h3>
        <p>
          Even small changes in flexibility and timing made a noticeable difference in flight
          stability and climb capability. The project highlighted how sensitive flapping systems are
          to inertia, stiffness, and timing, and how control is tightly coupled to aerodynamics.
        </p>

        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>
          This is where my interest in biomimicry and unsteady aerodynamics really began. It taught
          me how different real hardware feels compared to idealized models, and how important it is
          to design mechanisms and experiments that are simple enough to debug but rich enough to
          show interesting physics.
