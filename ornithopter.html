        <h2>Ornithopter</h2>


        <p><strong>Summary —</strong>
          This is the project that started my career as a researcher! A project that focuses on 
          replicating the flapping motion used by birds. We created our first model using a dual
          crank mechanism and rigid flaps and... it failed :( Even though seeing it flap in place
          was quite funny, we knew we had to improve the model. I later implemented morphing using
          the configurations from my research in order to achieve a 7-second flight.
          
        </p>

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>
          We first focused on getting a robust mechanical system: repeatable flapping kinematics,
          acceptable structural stiffness, and a reasonable weight budget. Once the basic
          ornithopter flew, I experimented with small morphing elements at the wing trailing edge
          and adjusted flapping frequency and amplitude to see how they affected thrust and control.

        <h3>Key observations</h3>
        <p>
          I noticed that flexibility plays a huge role when it comes to improving propulsive 
          performance. When we started off, we were using rigid flaps made of balsa, and that didn't 
          work at all. So, one of my friends came up with the idea of using Monokote instead of flaps.
          We built a frame for the Monokote, which helped improve the thrust by a significant margin. 
          However, it was still not able to fly. This was when I came up with the integrating some sort
          of active flexibility component in our ornithopter. After conducting extensive research on morphing
          wings, I was able to narrow down which configurations might be useful in our ornithopter and
          integrated the right morphing configurations to achieve flight.

        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>
          This is where my interest in biomimicry and unsteady aerodynamics really began. It taught me a lot
          of things, but primarily, the difference between computational models and actual real-life projects. 
          Integrating the configurations from my study on morphing wings was not nearly as easy as I thought
          it would be. Every other day, there would be a small thing we forgot to take into account, waiting 
          for the 3D prints or procurement of items, and this led to a lot of trial and error. It taught me the
          importance of patience when it comes to working on projects.
