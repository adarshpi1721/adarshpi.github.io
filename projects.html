                        <h3>Morphing Foils — Biomimicry of Fish Locomotion</h3>
                        <p>
                            Ongoing research combining chordwise trailing-edge morphing with pitching–heaving 
                            motion to replicate fish-like locomotion and improve propulsion. Using ALE-based 
                            2D models and DMD wake analysis, I studied how morph timing affects thrust, 
                            efficiency, and wake structure. This work led to thrust increases of ~31% and 
                            efficiency gains of ~12%, and was presented at FMFP ’24 and submitted to 
                            Physics of Fluids.

                        <p>
                            I led the design of a dual-crank active flapping mechanism to replicate bird-like 
                            motion. After achieving controlled kinematics, I integrated simple trailing-edge 
                            morphing to improve thrust and stability. We achieved a stable 7-second test flight, 
                            and this project is what pushed me deeper into biomimicry and flapping-wing aerodynamics.

                        <p>
                            I worked on passive VIV suppression strategies while helping build and validate 
                            a low-speed wind tunnel facility (up to ~96% accuracy). I developed an OpenFOAM 
                            solver for 2D VIV, explored passive devices like splitter plates and control cylinders, 
                            and compared simulation trends with experimental data.

                        <p>
                            My thesis project at IIT Bombay explores how Knudsen-number effects influence 
                            beam directionality and flux. Using rarefied-gas models and particle-style 
                            simulations, I study how nozzle geometry and background pressure determine beam 
                            collimation for applications in biomedical imaging.

                        <p>
                            During my internship at DHIO, I applied CFD tools like ParticleWorks and ASAP to 
                            industry problems. I worked on simulating flow near drone rotor tips to study 
                            tip losses and noise signatures, and analyzed heat conduction in graphene 
                            nanoribbons for thermal management studies.
