        <h2>Drone Rotor Flow & Graphene Conduction (Internship)</h2>

        <p><strong>Summary —</strong>
          At DHIO I applied CFD skills to industry-scale problems using ParticleWorks and ASAP.
          The work focused on flow near drone rotor tips and conduction in graphene nanoribbons,
          with an emphasis on producing simulation results that engineers could directly use.
        </p>

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>
          I worked on two main threads: simulating rotor-tip flows to understand losses and
          acoustic behavior, and studying heat conduction in graphene-based geometries at
          relevant operating conditions. My job was to set up robust boundary conditions, run
          parametric cases, and summarize the trends clearly.
        </p>

        <h3>Key observations</h3>
        <p>
          The rotor simulations suggested small geometry changes that reduce peak tip velocities
          and potentially lower noise. The conduction studies showed how ribbon width and edge
          characteristics influence effective thermal transport, which is important for thermal
          management design.
        </p>

        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>
          The internship was a good reality check on how simulations are used in practice:
          reliability, turnaround time, and clear communication are as important as accuracy.
          I also got comfortable adapting from academic solvers to industry tools and workflows.
