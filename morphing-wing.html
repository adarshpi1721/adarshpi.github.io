        <p><strong>Summary —</strong>
          This project looks at how chordwise trailing-edge morphing can improve the propulsive
          performance of a flapping foil. I used an ALE-based 2D solver to combine morphing with
          pitching–heaving motion, and studied how morph timing and amplitude affect thrust,
          efficiency, and wake structure. Well-timed morphing produced gains of roughly 31% in
          thrust and noticeable improvements in efficiency.
        </p>

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>
          I started with a baseline pitching–heaving kinematic and added morphing as an additional,
          controllable degree of freedom. I then:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ran parametric sweeps over morph amplitude and phase relative to the heaving motion.</li>
          <li>Computed time-averaged thrust, lift, and power coefficients for each case.</li>
          <li>Used DMD on wake snapshots to understand which flow modes were strengthened or weakened by morphing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key findings</h3>
        <p>
          The main result was that morph timing is critical: morphing that reinforces the formation
          of thrust-producing vortices can significantly boost performance, while poorly timed
          morphing can actually hurt thrust. The wake structure in the best cases showed a stronger
          and more coherent reverse von Kármán street.
        </p>

        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>
          This project taught me how sensitive unsteady propulsion is to phase relationships, and
          how small changes in geometry and timing can completely change the wake. It also gave me
          experience in building interpretable CFD setups and using modal analysis tools like DMD to
          explain why a given configuration performs better.
