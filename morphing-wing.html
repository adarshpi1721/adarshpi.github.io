            <p><strong>Summary —</strong>
                This project merges two ideas: using trailing-edge morphing to actively tune flapping-foil kinematics, 
                and understanding how fish use body flexibility to shape their wake. I built ALE-based 2D models to 
                simulate morphing–pitching–heaving motion and explored how timing (phase), amplitude, and morph rate 
                influence thrust, power, and wake structure. The main finding was that well-timed morphing can increase 
                thrust by ~31% and efficiency by ~12%.
            </p>

            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>
                I developed a deliberately simple but physically interpretable ALE 2D model. The steps were:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Define a baseline pitching–heaving motion, then add morphing as an extra degree of freedom.</li>
                <li>Run parametric sweeps on morph timing (phase), amplitude, and rate.</li>
                <li>Analyze wake dynamics using DMD to see which modes strengthen or weaken propulsion.</li>
                <li>Compare morphing runs against the non-morphing baseline to quantify gains.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key findings</h3>
            <p>
                Morphing effectively reshapes the vortex pairing process, creating stronger reverse von Kármán wakes 
                when timed correctly. Poorly timed morphing weakens thrust, so performance is extremely phase-sensitive. 
                The strongest cases showed higher wake coherence and significantly improved force production.
            </p>

            <h3>What I learned</h3>
            <p>
                This project taught me how sensitive unsteady propulsion is to phase and geometry, and how small 
                kinematic changes can completely reshape the wake. I also learned how to balance numerical modeling 
                with physical intuition and how to use DMD to understand the “why” behind thrust improvements.
