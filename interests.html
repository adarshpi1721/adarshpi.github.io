                <h3>Philosophy</h3>
                <p>
                    Philosophy is probably the non-technical subject I care about the most. I tend to gravitate toward
                    ethics, existentialism, and the philosophy of religion—fields that try to answer what it means to 
                    live well and honestly. What I enjoy most is understanding how thinkers arrive at their ideas: 
                    the assumptions they make, the experiences that shaped them, and how their logic unfolds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Epictetus taught me to focus on what I can control. Aristotle’s view of deliberate virtue 
                    changed the way I think about habit. Dostoevsky forces you to confront uncomfortable parts 
                    of human nature, while Emerson feels like a reminder to remain self-directed. Schopenhauer’s 
                    pessimism, oddly enough, is grounding. Philosophy matters to me because it directly shapes how 
                    people think, act, and grow.

                <h3>Tennis</h3>
                <p>
                    Tennis has been a part of my life ever since I was a kid. I grew up playing casually and it has 
                    stayed with me as something I genuinely enjoy—both playing and watching. Tennis is very personal; 
                    you’re alone on the court, constantly adapting and thinking through each point. It’s a mix of 
                    strategy, rhythm, and focus that I find calming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Federer will always be my favorite to watch—he made tennis look effortless. These days, I follow 
                    Jannik Sinner quite closely. The sport has always been a small refuge for me, a way to reset and 
                    clear my head.

                <h3>Reading</h3>
                <p>
                    Books have influenced me more than almost anything else. I read a lot of classic literature, not 
                    because it’s old, but because older books tend to be more honest about human nature. They force you 
                    to engage with ideas that aren’t always comfortable or straightforward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I enjoy most is that reading lets you inhabit someone else’s mind. Every book reflects the 
                    writer’s personality, fears, and worldview. Some books stay with you long after you finish them 
                    because they arrive at the exact moment you needed them.

                <h3>Sketching</h3>
                <p>
                    I started sketching seriously in high school and slowly moved from semi-realism to anatomy drawing. 
                    Sketching forces you to slow down and really observe details—the shapes, proportions, and subtle 
                    asymmetries that you’d otherwise miss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a strange way, it overlaps with engineering: both require patience, careful observation, and a 
                    willingness to iterate. These days I mostly draw anatomy because it’s structured enough to improve 
                    with practice but open enough to stay creative.

                <h3>Piano</h3>
                <p>
                    Piano was a big part of my childhood. I learned Für Elise using an old electric keyboard that lit 
                    up the keys, and I still remember the feeling of playing it from start to finish for the first time. 
                    Music has always been tied to nostalgia for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I play mostly for fun—usually songs I like rather than anything too technical. It’s something 
                    I come back to whenever I want a break or when I feel like doing something creative without any 
                    pressure to “improve.”
