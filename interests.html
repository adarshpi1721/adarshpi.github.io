                <h3>Philosophy</h3>
                <p>
                    I’ve always been drawn to questions about how we should live, what makes a meaningful life, 
                    and why people believe the things they do. I tend to read ethics, existentialism, and philosophy 
                    of religion, and I enjoy seeing how different thinkers built complete worldviews from first 
                    principles. Some of my favorites are Epictetus, Aristotle, Dostoevsky (who I count as a 
                    philosopher in spirit), Emerson, and Schopenhauer. For me, philosophy matters because it 
                    directly shapes how we think, act, and grow as people.

                <h3>Tennis</h3>
                <p>
                    I’ve been playing tennis since I was a kid, and it’s still one of my favorite ways to unwind. 
                    My childhood dream was to win a Grand Slam someday, and although that part didn’t work out, 
                    the sport stayed with me. Federer will always be the most enjoyable player to watch, but these 
                    days I follow Jannik Sinner pretty closely too.

                <h3>Reading</h3>
                <p>
                    Books have shaped my thinking more than anything else. I read a lot of classic literature, 
                    but I’ve realized that almost any book becomes meaningful if you try to understand the 
                    writer’s mindset—their fears, beliefs, and what they were trying to express. Reading feels 
                    like a direct window into another person’s internal world, and I’ve always valued that.

                <h3>Sketching</h3>
                <p>
                    I got into drawing during high school and started with semi-realism before moving into 
                    anatomy studies. Sketching forces me to slow down and really observe details, which oddly 
                    also helps in engineering work where pattern recognition and careful observation matter 
                    just as much.

                <h3>Piano</h3>
                <p>
                    Piano was a big part of my childhood, and even now I love sitting down to play pieces I enjoy. 
                    I still remember learning Für Elise just by following the lights on an old electric keyboard. 
                    These days I don’t focus much on improving technique, but I enjoy learning songs I like and 
                    playing whenever I get the chance.
